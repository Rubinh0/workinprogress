      I want to publish here:

    <h2>1984.py</h2>
    <h3>What does 1984.py does?</h3>
    <p>
      1984.py is a simple TUI (text-based User Interface) programm that helps
      estimating your progress in reading the book 1984.

        <h3> How did I made it?</h3>
    <p>This programm needed a few things:
        <ul>
        <li> setting the length of the book (in my case it's from page 11 to page 439) </li>
        <li> taking the input (at which page you're at)</li>
        <li> doing the pourcentage of read pages</li>
        <li> based on the input estimaing how many time you will need til you finish the book</li>
        <li> setting a progress bar</li>
        <li> doing ASCII art to make it prettier</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
