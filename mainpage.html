	<h1>Welcome to <em>my Baustelle</em>.</h1>
	<hr>
<p>This is my first website that will be used to learn and practice HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's ugly because in progress.</p>
<p> So I have a few interest and think I could brag about, that will each deserve its own page (could take a long while). These are :</p>
<ul>
	<li>Coding</li>
	<li>Photography</li>
	<li><a href=https://rubinh0.github.io/workinprogress/maths.html>Maths </a></li>
	<li>Misc</li>
